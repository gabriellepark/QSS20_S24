       "      <td>PORTLAND, Oregon. – Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 23, who was convicted in 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) in connection with a plot to detonate a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, was sentenced today to serve 30 years in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.  The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.  The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed’s 14-day trial, said “the intended crime was horrific,” and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, “never once expressed a change of heart.”  King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant “wanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.”  King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.     “With today’s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,” said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  “The evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.  Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud’s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.  This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.  The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.” “This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,” said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.  “With the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.   I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.  I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.”  According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.  Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud’s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.  In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: “yes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.”  Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali’s associate.  Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali’s.  Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.  At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.  Mohamud also said that he wanted to become “operational.”  Asked what he meant by “operational,” Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.  Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.  The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.  Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.  On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.  During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.  In response, Mohamud noted, “I want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.”  Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.  On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.  On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was “beautiful.”  Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.  The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D. Knight and Pamala Holsinger from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.  Trial Attorney Jolie F. Zimmerman, from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, assisted. # # # 14-1077</td>\n",

       "      <td>$1 Million in Restitution Payments Announced to Preserve North Carolina Wetlands</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON – North Carolina’s Waccamaw River watershed will benefit from a $1 million restitution order from a federal court, funding environmental projects to acquire and preserve wetlands in an area damaged by illegal releases of wastewater from a corporate hog farm, announced Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina Thomas G. Walker; Director Greg McLeod from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; and Camilla M. Herlevich, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust.   Freedman Farms Inc. was sentenced in February 2012 to five years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines, restitution and community service payments for violating the Clean Water Act when it discharged hog waste into a stream that leads to the Waccamaw River.  William B. Freedman, president of Freedman Farms, was sentenced to six months in prison to be followed by six months of home confinement.  Freedman Farms also is required to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance program and institute an annual training program.   In an order issued on April 19, 2012, the court ordered that the defendants would be responsible for restitution of $1 million in the form of five annual payments starting in January 2013, which the court will direct to the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust (NCCLT).  The NCCLT plans to use the money to acquire and conserve land along streams in the Waccamaw watershed.  The court also directed a $75,000 community service payment to the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network, an organization dedicated to environmental law enforcement training and information sharing in the region.    “The resolution of the case against Freedman Farms demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to enforcing the Clean Water Act to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” said Assistant Attorney General Moreno.  “The court-ordered restitution in this case will conserve wetlands for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.  By enforcing the nation’s environmental laws, we will continue to ensure that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) operate without threatening our drinking water, the health of our communities and the environment.”   “This office is committed to doing our part to hold accountable those who commit crimes against our environment, which can cause serious health problems to residents and damage the environment that makes North Carolina such a beautiful place to live and visit,” said U.S. Attorney Walker.   “This case shows what we can accomplish when our SBI agents work closely with their local, state and federal partners to investigate environmental crimes and hold the polluters accountable,” said Director McLeod.  “We’ll continue our efforts to fight illegal pollution that damages our water and puts the public’s health at risk.”    “The Waccamaw is unique and wild,” said Director Herlevich of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. “Its watershed includes some of the most extensive cypress gum swamps in the state, and its headwaters at Lake Waccamaw contain fish that are found nowhere else on Earth.  We appreciate the trust of the court and the U. S. Attorney, and we look forward to using these funds for conservation projects in a river system that is one of our top conservation priorities.”   According to evidence presented in court, in December 2007 Freedman Farms discharged hog waste into Browder’s Branch, a tributary to the Waccamaw River that flows through the White Marsh, a large wetlands complex.  Freedman Farms, located in Columbus County, N.C., is in the business of raising hogs for market, and this particular farm had some 4,800 hogs.  The hog waste was supposed to be directed to two lagoons for treatment and disposal.  Instead, hog waste was discharged from Freedman Farms directly into Browder’s Branch.    The Clean Water Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly or negligently discharge a pollutant into a water of the United States.    The Freedman case was investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the EPA Science and Ecosystem Support Division.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Gaston B. Williams of the Eastern District of North Carolina and Trial Attorney Mary Dee Carraway of the Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.   The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust is celebrating its 20th anniversary of saving special lands in eastern North Carolina. The organization has protected nearly 50,000 acres of lands with scenic, recreational, historic and ecological values. North Carolina Coastal Land Trust has saved streams and wetlands that provide clean water, forests that are havens for wildlife, working farms that provide local food and nature parks that everyone can enjoy.  More information about the Coastal Land Trust is available at www.coastallandtrust.org.</td>\n",

       "      <td>$1 Million Settlement Reached for Natural Resource Damages at Superfund Site in Massachusetts</td>\n",
       "      <td>BOSTON– A $1-million settlement has been reached for natural resource damages (NRD) at the Blackburn &amp; Union Privileges Superfund Site in Walpole, Mass., the Departments of Justice and Interior (DOI), and the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General announced today.                The Blackburn &amp; Union Privileges Superfund Site includes 22 acres of contaminated land and water in Walpole. The contamination resulted from the operations of various industrial facilities dating back to the 19th century that exposed the site to asbestos, arsenic, lead and other hazardous substances.                The private parties involved in the settlement include two former owners and operators of the site, W.R. Grace &amp; Co.– Conn. and Tyco Healthcare Group LP, as well as the current owners, BIM Investment Corp. and Shaffer Realty Nominee Trust.               From about 1915 to 1936, a predecessor of W.R. Grace manufactured asbestos brake linings and clutch linings on a large portion of the property. From 1946 to about 1983, a predecessor of Tyco Healthcare operated a cotton fabric manufacturing business, which used caustic solutions, on a portion of the property.               In a 2010 settlement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the four private parties agreed to perform a remedial action to clean up the site at an estimated cost of $13 million. The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.               “This settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,” said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.               “The citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,” Attorney General Martha Coakley said. “We are pleased that today’s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.”                 The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).               In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS’s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth’s assessment costs.       “This settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.  I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth’s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       “This settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,” said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. “We look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.”               “More than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,” said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. “We will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.”                Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site. The site has been listed on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1994.        The consent decree is subject to a public comment period and court approval. A copy of the consent decree and instructions about how to submit comments is available on www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html  .               After the consent decree is approved, EEA and FWS will develop proposed restoration plans to use the settlement funds for restoration projects. The proposed restoration plans will also be made available to the public for review and comment.                Assistant Attorney General Matthew Brock of Massachusetts Attorney General Coakley's Environmental Protection Division handled this matter.  Attorney Jennifer Davis of MassDEP, Attorney Anna Blumkin of EEA and MassDEP’s NRD Coordinator Karen Pelto also worked on this settlement.</td>\n",

       "      <td>10 Las Vegas Men Indicted \\r\\nfor Falsifying Vehicle Emissions Tests</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal grand jury in Las Vegas today returned indictments against 10 Nevada-certified emissions testers for falsifying vehicle emissions test reports, the Justice Department announced.   Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:     Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \"clean scanning\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle’s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle’s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \"pass\" or \"fail\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.     \"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\"    \"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.    The case was investigated by the EPA, Criminal Investigation Division; and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Compliance Enforcement Division. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada and the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) announced today that two subsidiaries of Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc.—Emhart Industries Inc. and Black &amp; Decker Inc.—have agreed to clean up dioxin contaminated sediment and soil at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site in North Providence and Johnston, Rhode Island.  “We are pleased to reach a resolution through collaborative work with the responsible parties, EPA, and other stakeholders,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey H. Wood for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division . “Today’s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.” “This settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,” said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “The Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.” “Successfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. “We are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.” “We are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,” said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. “The settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.” The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State’s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.  Under the settlement, Emhart and Black &amp; Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black &amp; Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart’s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.  The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days.

       "0  PORTLAND, Oregon. – Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 23, who was convicted in 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) in connection with a plot to detonate a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, was sentenced today to serve 30 years in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.  The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.  The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed’s 14-day trial, said “the intended crime was horrific,” and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, “never once expressed a change of heart.”  King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant “wanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.”  King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.     “With today’s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,” said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  “The evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.  Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud’s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.  This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.  The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.” “This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,” said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.  “With the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.   I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.  I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.”  According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.  Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud’s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.  In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: “yes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.”  Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali’s associate.  Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali’s.  Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.  At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.  Mohamud also said that he wanted to become “operational.”  Asked what he meant by “operational,” Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.  Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.  The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.  Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.  On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.  During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.  In response, Mohamud noted, “I want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.”  Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.  On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.  On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was “beautiful.”  Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.  The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D. Knight and Pamala Holsinger from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.  Trial Attorney Jolie F. Zimmerman, from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, assisted. # # # 14-1077   \n",

Moreno, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina Thomas G. Walker; Director Greg McLeod from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; and Camilla M. Herlevich, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust.   Freedman Farms Inc. was sentenced in February 2012 to five years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines, restitution and community service payments for violating the Clean Water Act when it discharged hog waste into a stream that leads to the Waccamaw River.  William B. Freedman, president of Freedman Farms, was sentenced to six months in prison to be followed by six months of home confinement.  Freedman Farms also is required to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance program and institute an annual training program.   In an order issued on April 19, 2012, the court ordered that the defendants would be responsible for restitution of $1 million in the form of five annual payments starting in January 2013, which the court will direct to the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust (NCCLT).  The NCCLT plans to use the money to acquire and conserve land along streams in the Waccamaw watershed.  The court also directed a $75,000 community service payment to the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network, an organization dedicated to environmental law enforcement training and information sharing in the region.    “The resolution of the case against Freedman Farms demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to enforcing the Clean Water Act to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” said Assistant Attorney General Moreno.  “The court-ordered restitution in this case will conserve wetlands for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.  By enforcing the nation’s environmental laws, we will continue to ensure that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) operate without threatening our drinking water, the health of our communities and the environment.”   “This office is committed to doing our part to hold accountable those who commit crimes against our environment, which can cause serious health problems to residents and damage the environment that makes North Carolina such a beautiful place to live and visit,” said U.S. Attorney Walker.   “This case shows what we can accomplish when our SBI agents work closely with their local, state and federal partners to investigate environmental crimes and hold the polluters accountable,” said Director McLeod.  “We’ll continue our efforts to fight illegal pollution that damages our water and puts the public’s health at risk.”    “The Waccamaw is unique and wild,” said Director Herlevich of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. “Its watershed includes some of the most extensive cypress gum swamps in the state, and its headwaters at Lake Waccamaw contain fish that are found nowhere else on Earth.  We appreciate the trust of the court and the U. S. Attorney, and we look forward to using these funds for conservation projects in a river system that is one of our top conservation priorities.”   According to evidence presented in court, in December 2007 Freedman Farms discharged hog waste into Browder’s Branch, a tributary to the Waccamaw River that flows through the White Marsh, a large wetlands complex.  Freedman Farms, located in Columbus County, N.C., is in the business of raising hogs for market, and this particular farm had some 4,800 hogs.  The hog waste was supposed to be directed to two lagoons for treatment and disposal.  Instead, hog waste was discharged from Freedman Farms directly into Browder’s Branch.    The Clean Water Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly or negligently discharge a pollutant into a water of the United States.    The Freedman case was investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the EPA Science and Ecosystem Support Division.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Gaston B. Williams of the Eastern District of North Carolina and Trial Attorney Mary Dee Carraway of the Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.   The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust is celebrating its 20th anniversary of saving special lands in eastern North Carolina. The organization has protected nearly 50,000 acres of lands with scenic, recreational, historic and ecological values. North Carolina Coastal Land Trust has saved streams and wetlands that provide clean water, forests that are havens for wildlife, working farms that provide local food and nature parks that everyone can enjoy.  More information about the Coastal Land Trust is available at www.coastallandtrust.org.   \n",

The contamination resulted from the operations of various industrial facilities dating back to the 19th century that exposed the site to asbestos, arsenic, lead and other hazardous substances.                The private parties involved in the settlement include two former owners and operators of the site, W.R. Grace & Co.– Conn. and Tyco Healthcare Group LP, as well as the current owners, BIM Investment Corp. and Shaffer Realty Nominee Trust.               From about 1915 to 1936, a predecessor of W.R. Grace manufactured asbestos brake linings and clutch linings on a large portion of the property. From 1946 to about 1983, a predecessor of Tyco Healthcare operated a cotton fabric manufacturing business, which used caustic solutions, on a portion of the property.               In a 2010 settlement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the four private parties agreed to perform a remedial action to clean up the site at an estimated cost of $13 million. The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.               “This settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,” said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.               “The citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,” Attorney General Martha Coakley said. “We are pleased that today’s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.”                 The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).               In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS’s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth’s assessment costs.       “This settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.  I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth’s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       “This settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,” said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. “We look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.”               “More than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,” said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. “We will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.”                Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site. The site has been listed on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1994.        The consent decree is subject to a public comment period and court approval. A copy of the consent decree and instructions about how to submit comments is available on www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html  .               After the consent decree is approved, EEA and FWS will develop proposed restoration plans to use the settlement funds for restoration projects. The proposed restoration plans will also be made available to the public for review and comment.                Assistant Attorney General Matthew Brock of Massachusetts Attorney General Coakley's Environmental Protection Division handled this matter.  Attorney Jennifer Davis of MassDEP, Attorney Anna Blumkin of EEA and MassDEP’s NRD Coordinator Karen Pelto also worked on this settlement.   \n",

Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:     Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \"clean scanning\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle’s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle’s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \"pass\" or \"fail\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.     \"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\"    \"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.    The case was investigated by the EPA, Criminal Investigation Division; and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Compliance Enforcement Division. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada and the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section.   \n",

Wood for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division . “Today’s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.” “This settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,” said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “The Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.” “Successfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. “We are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.” “We are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,” said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. “The settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.” The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State’s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.  Under the settlement, Emhart and Black & Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black & Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart’s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.  The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days.

Cureton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with an African-American family’s housing rights, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, Halfin threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment.  According to documents filed in connection with the guilty plea, on Dec. 19, 2017, Halfin purchased a baby doll at a Wal-Mart in Grapevine, Texas. He took a rope, fashioned it into a noose, and hung the baby doll from the noose. Halfin then hung the rope noose and baby doll on the railing directly in front of the only staircase the family could use to access their apartment. Halfin did so, knowing that this display would be particularly intimidating for the family who had a young daughter. In addition, the defendant referenced in his factual basis repeated intimidation of and interference with the same African-American family on other occasions. “The Justice Department will not tolerate acts of intimidation and fear, or illegal threats against any individual or family because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney John Gore. “We will continue to prosecute hate crime offenders.” “No one should be afraid to go home at night,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.  “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.” Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine. His sentencing is scheduled for October 24. This case was investigated by the FBI and the Grapevine Police Department. The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Rebekah Bailey of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section and Assistant United States Attorney Nicole Dana.</td>\n",

Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Donald J. Cazayoux Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana.        Miller, 44, was convicted by a federal jury following a two-day trial.  U.S. District Judge James J. Brady presided over the trial.       Evidence presented at trial showed that from October 2007 to May 2008, Miller sexually abused a 12-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl and produced numerous photographs of the abuse.  According to trial evidence, forensic examination of Miller’s computer revealed that Miller had used his computer to print and possess numerous images of child pornography, including both the images of child pornography he had produced and images of other child victims.                 Miller faces a maximum statutory sentence of 30 years in prison for each count of production of child pornography and 10 years in prison for the possession of child pornography count.       The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Alecia Riewerts Wolak of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard L.

       "5247  Glenn Eugene Halfin, 64, from Grapevine, Texas, appeared today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey L. Cureton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with an African-American family’s housing rights, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, Halfin threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment.  According to documents filed in connection with the guilty plea, on Dec. 19, 2017, Halfin purchased a baby doll at a Wal-Mart in Grapevine, Texas. He took a rope, fashioned it into a noose, and hung the baby doll from the noose. Halfin then hung the rope noose and baby doll on the railing directly in front of the only staircase the family could use to access their apartment. Halfin did so, knowing that this display would be particularly intimidating for the family who had a young daughter. In addition, the defendant referenced in his factual basis repeated intimidation of and interference with the same African-American family on other occasions. “The Justice Department will not tolerate acts of intimidation and fear, or illegal threats against any individual or family because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney John Gore. “We will continue to prosecute hate crime offenders.” “No one should be afraid to go home at night,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.  “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.” Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine. His sentencing is scheduled for October 24. This case was investigated by the FBI and the Grapevine Police Department. The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Rebekah Bailey of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section and Assistant United States Attorney Nicole Dana.   \n",

Miller, of Denham Springs, La., was convicted late yesterday of two counts of producing and one count of possessing child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Donald J. Cazayoux Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana.        Miller, 44, was convicted by a federal jury following a two-day trial.  U.S. District Judge James J. Brady presided over the trial.       Evidence presented at trial showed that from October 2007 to May 2008, Miller sexually abused a 12-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl and produced numerous photographs of the abuse.  According to trial evidence, forensic examination of Miller’s computer revealed that Miller had used his computer to print and possess numerous images of child pornography, including both the images of child pornography he had produced and images of other child victims.                 Miller faces a maximum statutory sentence of 30 years in prison for each count of production of child pornography and 10 years in prison for the possession of child pornography count.       The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Alecia Riewerts Wolak of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard L. Bourgeois Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana.  The investigation was conducted by the FBI, the Denham Springs Police Department and the Louisiana Attorney General’s Office.   \n",

       "      <td>The U.S. Department of Justice today filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the owners and manager of three Edmonds, Washington apartment buildings refused to rent their apartments to families with children, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.    “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.”   “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes of the Western District of Washington. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.”   The complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Washington. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband, and their one year old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice.    The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, and civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.   The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin and disability. More information about the Civil Rights Division and the civil rights laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt  and https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/civil-rights. Individuals who believe that they have been victims of housing discrimination may call the Justice Department at 1-800-896-7743, email the Justice Department at fairhousing@usdoj.gov, or contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 or through its website at www.hud.gov.   The case is being jointly handled by the Department’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington.   The complaint is an allegation of unlawful conduct. The allegations must still be proven in federal court.</td>\n",

Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Hansen of the Central District of Illinois.   Sarah M. Nixon, 48, of Montreal, Canada, was sentenced before U.S. District Judge Colin S. Bruce of the Central District of Illinois. On Dec. 21, 2016, a federal jury found Nixon guilty of one count of international parental kidnapping for taking her minor child from the United States to Canada in July 2015, with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of the father’s rights.   Evidence at trial established that after a custody trial where it was apparent that Nixon would lose custody of her six-year-old daughter, Nixon fled the United States with the child in the middle of the night. When she did not appear for the custody ruling and neither she nor her daughter could be located, law enforcement issued a child abduction alert. Nixon and the child were eventually located in a farmhouse in rural Ontario, Canada. Authorities then returned the child to the father. Nixon was arrested in New York on Sept. 20, 2015, as she attempted to return to the United States.    Trial Attorneys Elly M. Peirson and Lauren S. Kupersmith of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section prosecuted the case. The FBI; Urbana, Illinois, Police Department; University of Illinois Police Department; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services; Ontario Provincial Police; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection investigated the case, with assistance from the Champaign County, Illinois, State’s Attorney’s Office and the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs.</td>\n",

The memo directed components and United States Attorney’s Offices to use the guidance in litigation, advice to the Executive Branch, operations, grants, and all other aspects of the Department’s work. In order to ensure compliance with the Attorney General’s memo, the USAM will be updated with language that directs relevant Department of Justice components to: The updated USAM will also instruct relevant Justice Department components to consult the 20 religious liberty principles laid out in the Attorney General’s October 6 memo when considering whether the notice or approval requirements are initiated. In order to fully effectuate the approval and notice requirements in the updated USAM, the Department will instruct all U.S. Attorneys to designate a point of contact to lead these efforts for their office. “Religious liberty is an inalienable right protected by the Constitution, and defending it is one of the most important things we do at the Department of Justice,” said Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Sessions issued a robust and clear guidance document in October that clearly explains how the federal government is to apply the religious liberty protections currently on the books.  The requirement that each of the U.S. Attorney offices designate a religious liberty point of contact will ensure that the Attorney General’s Memorandum is effectively implemented. The designees will be responsible for working directly with the leadership offices on civil cases related to religious liberty, ensuring that these cases receive the rigorous attention they deserve.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement with the city of Yonkers, New York, and the Yonkers Police Department (YPD) to resolve the department’s investigation of YPD and ensure constitutional policing. The agreement is the result of the department’s investigation of YPD under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  In June 2009, the United States sent the city a technical assistance letter that identified necessary reforms to YPD practices and policies in the areas of use of force, civilian complaints, investigations, supervisory oversight and training.  After receiving the department’s technical assistance letter, the city and YPD made substantial changes to its policies and procedures.  This agreement implements and further improves those policies and procedures and addresses the department’s remaining concerns.  “This agreement will ensure that the Yonkers Police Department continues to advance constitutional, effective and community-oriented policing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “Through clear policy guidance, data analysis and accountability systems, we believe these reforms will make the entire community safer and strengthen public trust in the police.” “This agreement ensures that the Yonkers Police Department polices in a way that keeps its citizens safe, while protecting their constitutional rights,” said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.  “The measures put in place with this agreement, including clear and reasonable use-of-force policies and guidance on how to properly evaluate and respond to use-of-force incidents, will make Yonkers safer for citizens and police alike.  We thank the Yonkers Police Department and the city of Yonkers for cooperating with our investigation, and for joining our effort to ensure that the Yonkers Police Department protects its citizens not only from physical harm, but also from violations of their constitutional rights.” The agreement is carefully tailored to address the department’s remaining concerns while also taking into account and seeking to build upon the positive reforms YPD has already made following the department’s investigation.  Under the agreement, the YPD will, among other things: The agreement also provides that consultants retained by the department will conduct compliance reviews to ensure that YPD has implemented the measures required by the agreement and issue public reports of those compliance reviews. This case is being handled by the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York. Yonkers Police Department Agreement</td>\n",

       "      <td>Justice Department Reaches Settlement to Reform Criminal Justice System in Hinds County, Mississippi</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Justice Department today reached a landmark settlement agreement to reform the criminal justice system in Hinds County, Mississippi.  The agreement resolves the department’s findings that the Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center – which together form the Hinds County Jail – failed to protect prisoners from violence and excessive force and held them past their court-ordered release dates, in violation of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The settlement agreement is the first of its kind to incorporate broader criminal justice system reform through diversion at the front end and reentry to the community after incarceration.  It creates a criminal justice coordinating committee that will help ensure the county’s systems operate effectively and efficiently, develop interventions to divert individuals in appropriate cases from arrest, detention and incarceration, and engage in community outreach.  To promote successful reentry, the agreement includes mechanisms for notifying community health providers when a person with serious mental illness is released to help the person transition safely back to the community.  The agreement also addresses unlawful enforcement of court-ordered fines and fees by ensuring that the county cannot incarcerate an individual for non-payment if the court does not first assess whether the individual is indigent. “Across the board, this settlement will make the Hinds County criminal justice system smarter and fairer,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “If implemented, these reforms will make pretrial detainees, prisoners, corrections staff and the entire community safer, while also ensuring that vulnerable individuals get access to the treatment, care and community services they need and deserve.  We commend the county for its commitment to making these reforms a reality.” “For too long, the conditions in the Jail have posed a serious challenge to law enforcement and the safety of our community,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis of the Southern District of Mississippi.  “I appreciate the commitment made by Hinds County officials to turn the page and begin making necessary reforms.” The settlement agreement – subject to approval by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi – requires the county to implement a series of reforms across various stages of the criminal justice system, including the following: Together these reforms aim to improve communication and coordination among criminal justice entities and community service providers to help individuals with mental illness transition back to the community and to reduce recidivism.  If approved by the federal district court, an independent monitor will be appointed to assess the county’s compliance.  In May 2015, the Justice Department completed a comprehensive investigation – which included on-site inspections, document reviews and stakeholder interviews by department experts and staff – and issued a findings letter that determined that Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center violated CRIPA by failing to protect prisoners from violence by other prisoners and from improper use of force by staff.  The department also found that inadequate staffing and training, a backlog in record filing and a lack of centralized information resulted in prisoners being held beyond court-ordered release dates. CRIPA authorizes the department to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional rights of persons confined in a jail, prison or other correctional facility.  For more information on the Civil Rights Division’s work in this area, please visit www.justice.gov/crt.

       "      <td>Justice Department Reaches Agreement with the City of Miami and the Miami Police Department to Implement Reforms on Officer-Involved Shootings</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.</td>\n",

Cureton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with an African-American family’s housing rights, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, Halfin threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment.  According to documents filed in connection with the guilty plea, on Dec. 19, 2017, Halfin purchased a baby doll at a Wal-Mart in Grapevine, Texas. He took a rope, fashioned it into a noose, and hung the baby doll from the noose. Halfin then hung the rope noose and baby doll on the railing directly in front of the only staircase the family could use to access their apartment. Halfin did so, knowing that this display would be particularly intimidating for the family who had a young daughter. In addition, the defendant referenced in his factual basis repeated intimidation of and interference with the same African-American family on other occasions. “The Justice Department will not tolerate acts of intimidation and fear, or illegal threats against any individual or family because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney John Gore. “We will continue to prosecute hate crime offenders.” “No one should be afraid to go home at night,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.  “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.” Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine.

Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Donald J. Cazayoux Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana.        Miller, 44, was convicted by a federal jury following a two-day trial.  U.S. District Judge James J.

Hayes of the Western District of Washington. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.”   The complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Washington. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband, and their one year old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice.    The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, and civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.   The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin and disability. More information about the Civil Rights Division and the civil rights laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt  and https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/civil-rights.

Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Hansen of the Central District of Illinois.   Sarah M. Nixon, 48, of Montreal, Canada, was sentenced before U.S. District Judge Colin S. Bruce of the Central District of Illinois. On Dec. 21, 2016, a federal jury found Nixon guilty of one count of international parental kidnapping for taking her minor child from the United States to Canada in July 2015, with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of the father’s rights.   Evidence at trial established that after a custody trial where it was apparent that Nixon would lose custody of her six-year-old daughter, Nixon fled the United States with the child in the middle of the night. When she did not appear for the custody ruling and neither she nor her daughter could be located, law enforcement issued a child abduction alert. Nixon and the child were eventually located in a farmhouse in rural Ontario, Canada. Authorities then returned the child to the father. Nixon was arrested in New York on Sept. 20, 2015, as she attempted to return to the United States.    Trial Attorneys Elly M. Peirson and Lauren S. Kupersmith of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section prosecuted the case.

The memo directed components and United States Attorney’s Offices to use the guidance in litigation, advice to the Executive Branch, operations, grants, and all other aspects of the Department’s work. In order to ensure compliance with the Attorney General’s memo, the USAM will be updated with language that directs relevant Department of Justice components to: The updated USAM will also instruct relevant Justice Department components to consult the 20 religious liberty principles laid out in the Attorney General’s October 6 memo when considering whether the notice or approval requirements are initiated. In order to fully effectuate the approval and notice requirements in the updated USAM, the Department will instruct all U.S. Attorneys to designate a point of contact to lead these efforts for their office. “Religious liberty is an inalienable right protected by the Constitution, and defending it is one of the most important things we do at the Department of Justice,” said Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Sessions issued a robust and clear guidance document in October that clearly explains how the federal government is to apply the religious liberty protections currently on the books.  The requirement that each of the U.S. Attorney offices designate a religious liberty point of contact will ensure that the Attorney General’s Memorandum is effectively implemented. The designees will be responsible for working directly with the leadership offices on civil cases related to religious liberty, ensuring that these cases receive the rigorous attention they deserve.   \n",

The agreement is the result of the department’s investigation of YPD under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  In June 2009, the United States sent the city a technical assistance letter that identified necessary reforms to YPD practices and policies in the areas of use of force, civilian complaints, investigations, supervisory oversight and training.  After receiving the department’s technical assistance letter, the city and YPD made substantial changes to its policies and procedures.  This agreement implements and further improves those policies and procedures and addresses the department’s remaining concerns.  “This agreement will ensure that the Yonkers Police Department continues to advance constitutional, effective and community-oriented policing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “Through clear policy guidance, data analysis and accountability systems, we believe these reforms will make the entire community safer and strengthen public trust in the police.” “This agreement ensures that the Yonkers Police Department polices in a way that keeps its citizens safe, while protecting their constitutional rights,” said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.  “The measures put in place with this agreement, including clear and reasonable use-of-force policies and guidance on how to properly evaluate and respond to use-of-force incidents, will make Yonkers safer for citizens and police alike.  We thank the Yonkers Police Department and the city of Yonkers for cooperating with our investigation, and for joining our effort to ensure that the Yonkers Police Department protects its citizens not only from physical harm, but also from violations of their constitutional rights.” The agreement is carefully tailored to address the department’s remaining concerns while also taking into account and seeking to build upon the positive reforms YPD has already made following the department’s investigation.  Under the agreement, the YPD will, among other things: The agreement also provides that consultants retained by the department will conduct compliance reviews to ensure that YPD has implemented the measures required by the agreement and issue public reports of those compliance reviews. This case is being handled by the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York. Yonkers Police Department Agreement   \n",
       "6905   The Justice Department today reached a landmark settlement agreement to reform the criminal justice system in Hinds County, Mississippi.  The agreement resolves the department’s findings that the Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center – which together form the Hinds County Jail – failed to protect prisoners from violence and excessive force and held them past their court-ordered release dates, in violation of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The settlement agreement is the first of its kind to incorporate broader criminal justice system reform through diversion at the front end and reentry to the community after incarceration.  It creates a criminal justice coordinating committee that will help ensure the county’s systems operate effectively and efficiently, develop interventions to divert individuals in appropriate cases from arrest, detention and incarceration, and engage in community outreach.  To promote successful reentry, the agreement includes mechanisms for notifying community health providers when a person with serious mental illness is released to help the person transition safely back to the community.  The agreement also addresses unlawful enforcement of court-ordered fines and fees by ensuring that the county cannot incarcerate an individual for non-payment if the court does not first assess whether the individual is indigent. “Across the board, this settlement will make the Hinds County criminal justice system smarter and fairer,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “If implemented, these reforms will make pretrial detainees, prisoners, corrections staff and the entire community safer, while also ensuring that vulnerable individuals get access to the treatment, care and community services they need and deserve.  We commend the county for its commitment to making these reforms a reality.” “For too long, the conditions in the Jail have posed a serious challenge to law enforcement and the safety of our community,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis of the Southern District of Mississippi.  “I appreciate the commitment made by Hinds County officials to turn the page and begin making necessary reforms.” The settlement agreement – subject to approval by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi – requires the county to implement a series of reforms across various stages of the criminal justice system, including the following: Together these reforms aim to improve communication and coordination among criminal justice entities and community service providers to help individuals with mental illness transition back to the community and to reduce recidivism.  If approved by the federal district court, an independent monitor will be appointed to assess the county’s compliance.  In May 2015, the Justice Department completed a comprehensive investigation – which included on-site inspections, document reviews and stakeholder interviews by department experts and staff – and issued a findings letter that determined that Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center violated CRIPA by failing to protect prisoners from violence by other prisoners and from improper use of force by staff.  The department also found that inadequate staffing and training, a backlog in record filing and a lack of centralized information resulted in prisoners being held beyond court-ordered release dates. CRIPA authorizes the department to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional rights of persons confined in a jail, prison or other correctional facility.  For more information on the Civil Rights Division’s work in this area, please visit www.justice.gov/crt.

Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.   \n",

       "      <td>In a nine-count indictment unsealed today, two Mississippi correctional officers were charged with beating an inmate and a third was charged with helping to cover it up.  The indictment charged Lawardrick Marsher, 28, and Robert Sturdivant, 47, officers at Mississippi State Penitentiary, in Parchman, Mississippi, with a beating that included kicking, punching and throwing the victim to the ground.  Marsher and Sturdivant were charged with violating the right of K.H., a convicted prisoner, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Sturdivant was also charged with failing to intervene while Marsher was punching and beating K.H.  The indictment alleges that their actions involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury to the victim. A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.</td>\n",

A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment   \n",
       "6727   The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.   \n",

       "      <td>Glenn Eugene Halfin, 64, from Grapevine, Texas, appeared today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey L. Cureton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with an African-American family’s housing rights, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, Halfin threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment.  According to documents filed in connection with the guilty plea, on Dec. 19, 2017, Halfin purchased a baby doll at a Wal-Mart in Grapevine, Texas. He took a rope, fashioned it into a noose, and hung the baby doll from the noose. Halfin then hung the rope noose and baby doll on the railing directly in front of the only staircase the family could use to access their apartment. Halfin did so, knowing that this display would be particularly intimidating for the family who had a young daughter. In addition, the defendant referenced in his factual basis repeated intimidation of and interference with the same African-American family on other occasions. “The Justice Department will not tolerate acts of intimidation and fear, or illegal threats against any individual or family because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney John Gore. “We will continue to prosecute hate crime offenders.” “No one should be afraid to go home at night,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.  “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.” Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine. His sentencing is scheduled for October 24. This case was investigated by the FBI and the Grapevine Police Department. The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Rebekah Bailey of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section and Assistant United States Attorney Nicole Dana.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The U.S. Department of Justice today filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the owners and manager of three Edmonds, Washington apartment buildings refused to rent their apartments to families with children, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.    “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.”   “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes of the Western District of Washington. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.”   The complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Washington. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband, and their one year old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice.    The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, and civil penalties.

       "      <td>A Canadian woman was sentenced to serve 26 months in prison following her December conviction for international parental kidnapping, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Hansen of the Central District of Illinois.   Sarah M. Nixon, 48, of Montreal, Canada, was sentenced before U.S. District Judge Colin S. Bruce of the Central District of Illinois. On Dec. 21, 2016, a federal jury found Nixon guilty of one count of international parental kidnapping for taking her minor child from the United States to Canada in July 2015, with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of the father’s rights.   Evidence at trial established that after a custody trial where it was apparent that Nixon would lose custody of her six-year-old daughter, Nixon fled the United States with the child in the middle of the night. When she did not appear for the custody ruling and neither she nor her daughter could be located, law enforcement issued a child abduction alert. Nixon and the child were eventually located in a farmhouse in rural Ontario, Canada. Authorities then returned the child to the father. Nixon was arrested in New York on Sept. 20, 2015, as she attempted to return to the United States.    Trial Attorneys Elly M. Peirson and Lauren S. Kupersmith of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section prosecuted the case. The FBI; Urbana, Illinois, Police Department; University of Illinois Police Department; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services; Ontario Provincial Police; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection investigated the case, with assistance from the Champaign County, Illinois, State’s Attorney’s Office and the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Department of Justice today announced the update of the United States Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) with a new section titled, “Associate Attorney General’s Approval and Notice Requirements for Issues Implicating Religious Liberty.” On Oct. 6, 2017, the Attorney General issued a Memorandum for All Executive Departments and Agencies entitled Federal Law Protections for Religious Liberty. The memo directed components and United States Attorney’s Offices to use the guidance in litigation, advice to the Executive Branch, operations, grants, and all other aspects of the Department’s work. In order to ensure compliance with the Attorney General’s memo, the USAM will be updated with language that directs relevant Department of Justice components to: The updated USAM will also instruct relevant Justice Department components to consult the 20 religious liberty principles laid out in the Attorney General’s October 6 memo when considering whether the notice or approval requirements are initiated. In order to fully effectuate the approval and notice requirements in the updated USAM, the Department will instruct all U.S. Attorneys to designate a point of contact to lead these efforts for their office. “Religious liberty is an inalienable right protected by the Constitution, and defending it is one of the most important things we do at the Department of Justice,” said Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Sessions issued a robust and clear guidance document in October that clearly explains how the federal government is to apply the religious liberty protections currently on the books.  The requirement that each of the U.S. Attorney offices designate a religious liberty point of contact will ensure that the Attorney General’s Memorandum is effectively implemented. The designees will be responsible for working directly with the leadership offices on civil cases related to religious liberty, ensuring that these cases receive the rigorous attention they deserve.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement with the city of Yonkers, New York, and the Yonkers Police Department (YPD) to resolve the department’s investigation of YPD and ensure constitutional policing. The agreement is the result of the department’s investigation of YPD under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  In June 2009, the United States sent the city a technical assistance letter that identified necessary reforms to YPD practices and policies in the areas of use of force, civilian complaints, investigations, supervisory oversight and training.  After receiving the department’s technical assistance letter, the city and YPD made substantial changes to its policies and procedures.  This agreement implements and further improves those policies and procedures and addresses the department’s remaining concerns.  “This agreement will ensure that the Yonkers Police Department continues to advance constitutional, effective and community-oriented policing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “Through clear policy guidance, data analysis and accountability systems, we believe these reforms will make the entire community safer and strengthen public trust in the police.” “This agreement ensures that the Yonkers Police Department polices in a way that keeps its citizens safe, while protecting their constitutional rights,” said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.  “The measures put in place with this agreement, including clear and reasonable use-of-force policies and guidance on how to properly evaluate and respond to use-of-force incidents, will make Yonkers safer for citizens and police alike.  We thank the Yonkers Police Department and the city of Yonkers for cooperating with our investigation, and for joining our effort to ensure that the Yonkers Police Department protects its citizens not only from physical harm, but also from violations of their constitutional rights.” The agreement is carefully tailored to address the department’s remaining concerns while also taking into account and seeking to build upon the positive reforms YPD has already made following the department’s investigation.  Under the agreement, the YPD will, among other things: The agreement also provides that consultants retained by the department will conduct compliance reviews to ensure that YPD has implemented the measures required by the agreement and issue public reports of those compliance reviews. This case is being handled by the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York. Yonkers Police Department Agreement</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department today reached a landmark settlement agreement to reform the criminal justice system in Hinds County, Mississippi.  The agreement resolves the department’s findings that the Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center – which together form the Hinds County Jail – failed to protect prisoners from violence and excessive force and held them past their court-ordered release dates, in violation of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The settlement agreement is the first of its kind to incorporate broader criminal justice system reform through diversion at the front end and reentry to the community after incarceration.  It creates a criminal justice coordinating committee that will help ensure the county’s systems operate effectively and efficiently, develop interventions to divert individuals in appropriate cases from arrest, detention and incarceration, and engage in community outreach.  To promote successful reentry, the agreement includes mechanisms for notifying community health providers when a person with serious mental illness is released to help the person transition safely back to the community.  The agreement also addresses unlawful enforcement of court-ordered fines and fees by ensuring that the county cannot incarcerate an individual for non-payment if the court does not first assess whether the individual is indigent. “Across the board, this settlement will make the Hinds County criminal justice system smarter and fairer,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “If implemented, these reforms will make pretrial detainees, prisoners, corrections staff and the entire community safer, while also ensuring that vulnerable individuals get access to the treatment, care and community services they need and deserve.  We commend the county for its commitment to making these reforms a reality.” “For too long, the conditions in the Jail have posed a serious challenge to law enforcement and the safety of our community,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis of the Southern District of Mississippi.  “I appreciate the commitment made by Hinds County officials to turn the page and begin making necessary reforms.” The settlement agreement – subject to approval by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi – requires the county to implement a series of reforms across various stages of the criminal justice system, including the following: Together these reforms aim to improve communication and coordination among criminal justice entities and community service providers to help individuals with mental illness transition back to the community and to reduce recidivism.  If approved by the federal district court, an independent monitor will be appointed to assess the county’s compliance.  In May 2015, the Justice Department completed a comprehensive investigation – which included on-site inspections, document reviews and stakeholder interviews by department experts and staff – and issued a findings letter that determined that Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center violated CRIPA by failing to protect prisoners from violence by other prisoners and from improper use of force by staff.  The department also found that inadequate staffing and training, a backlog in record filing and a lack of centralized information resulted in prisoners being held beyond court-ordered release dates. CRIPA authorizes the department to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional rights of persons confined in a jail, prison or other correctional facility.  For more information on the Civil Rights Division’s work in this area, please visit www.justice.gov/crt.

       "      <td>The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.</td>\n",

Cureton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with an African-American family’s housing rights, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, Halfin threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment.  According to documents filed in connection with the guilty plea, on Dec. 19, 2017, Halfin purchased a baby doll at a Wal-Mart in Grapevine, Texas. He took a rope, fashioned it into a noose, and hung the baby doll from the noose. Halfin then hung the rope noose and baby doll on the railing directly in front of the only staircase the family could use to access their apartment. Halfin did so, knowing that this display would be particularly intimidating for the family who had a young daughter. In addition, the defendant referenced in his factual basis repeated intimidation of and interference with the same African-American family on other occasions. “The Justice Department will not tolerate acts of intimidation and fear, or illegal threats against any individual or family because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney John Gore. “We will continue to prosecute hate crime offenders.” “No one should be afraid to go home at night,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.  “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.” Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine.

Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Donald J. Cazayoux Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana.        Miller, 44, was convicted by a federal jury following a two-day trial.  U.S. District Judge James J.

Hayes of the Western District of Washington. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.”   The complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Washington. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband, and their one year old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice.    The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, and civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.   The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin and disability. More information about the Civil Rights Division and the civil rights laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt  and https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/civil-rights.

Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Hansen of the Central District of Illinois.   Sarah M. Nixon, 48, of Montreal, Canada, was sentenced before U.S. District Judge Colin S. Bruce of the Central District of Illinois. On Dec. 21, 2016, a federal jury found Nixon guilty of one count of international parental kidnapping for taking her minor child from the United States to Canada in July 2015, with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of the father’s rights.   Evidence at trial established that after a custody trial where it was apparent that Nixon would lose custody of her six-year-old daughter, Nixon fled the United States with the child in the middle of the night. When she did not appear for the custody ruling and neither she nor her daughter could be located, law enforcement issued a child abduction alert. Nixon and the child were eventually located in a farmhouse in rural Ontario, Canada. Authorities then returned the child to the father. Nixon was arrested in New York on Sept. 20, 2015, as she attempted to return to the United States.    Trial Attorneys Elly M. Peirson and Lauren S. Kupersmith of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section prosecuted the case.

The memo directed components and United States Attorney’s Offices to use the guidance in litigation, advice to the Executive Branch, operations, grants, and all other aspects of the Department’s work. In order to ensure compliance with the Attorney General’s memo, the USAM will be updated with language that directs relevant Department of Justice components to: The updated USAM will also instruct relevant Justice Department components to consult the 20 religious liberty principles laid out in the Attorney General’s October 6 memo when considering whether the notice or approval requirements are initiated. In order to fully effectuate the approval and notice requirements in the updated USAM, the Department will instruct all U.S. Attorneys to designate a point of contact to lead these efforts for their office. “Religious liberty is an inalienable right protected by the Constitution, and defending it is one of the most important things we do at the Department of Justice,” said Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Sessions issued a robust and clear guidance document in October that clearly explains how the federal government is to apply the religious liberty protections currently on the books.  The requirement that each of the U.S. Attorney offices designate a religious liberty point of contact will ensure that the Attorney General’s Memorandum is effectively implemented. The designees will be responsible for working directly with the leadership offices on civil cases related to religious liberty, ensuring that these cases receive the rigorous attention they deserve.   \n",

The agreement is the result of the department’s investigation of YPD under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  In June 2009, the United States sent the city a technical assistance letter that identified necessary reforms to YPD practices and policies in the areas of use of force, civilian complaints, investigations, supervisory oversight and training.  After receiving the department’s technical assistance letter, the city and YPD made substantial changes to its policies and procedures.  This agreement implements and further improves those policies and procedures and addresses the department’s remaining concerns.  “This agreement will ensure that the Yonkers Police Department continues to advance constitutional, effective and community-oriented policing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “Through clear policy guidance, data analysis and accountability systems, we believe these reforms will make the entire community safer and strengthen public trust in the police.” “This agreement ensures that the Yonkers Police Department polices in a way that keeps its citizens safe, while protecting their constitutional rights,” said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.  “The measures put in place with this agreement, including clear and reasonable use-of-force policies and guidance on how to properly evaluate and respond to use-of-force incidents, will make Yonkers safer for citizens and police alike.  We thank the Yonkers Police Department and the city of Yonkers for cooperating with our investigation, and for joining our effort to ensure that the Yonkers Police Department protects its citizens not only from physical harm, but also from violations of their constitutional rights.” The agreement is carefully tailored to address the department’s remaining concerns while also taking into account and seeking to build upon the positive reforms YPD has already made following the department’s investigation.  Under the agreement, the YPD will, among other things: The agreement also provides that consultants retained by the department will conduct compliance reviews to ensure that YPD has implemented the measures required by the agreement and issue public reports of those compliance reviews. This case is being handled by the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York. Yonkers Police Department Agreement   \n",
       "6905   The Justice Department today reached a landmark settlement agreement to reform the criminal justice system in Hinds County, Mississippi.  The agreement resolves the department’s findings that the Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center – which together form the Hinds County Jail – failed to protect prisoners from violence and excessive force and held them past their court-ordered release dates, in violation of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The settlement agreement is the first of its kind to incorporate broader criminal justice system reform through diversion at the front end and reentry to the community after incarceration.  It creates a criminal justice coordinating committee that will help ensure the county’s systems operate effectively and efficiently, develop interventions to divert individuals in appropriate cases from arrest, detention and incarceration, and engage in community outreach.  To promote successful reentry, the agreement includes mechanisms for notifying community health providers when a person with serious mental illness is released to help the person transition safely back to the community.  The agreement also addresses unlawful enforcement of court-ordered fines and fees by ensuring that the county cannot incarcerate an individual for non-payment if the court does not first assess whether the individual is indigent. “Across the board, this settlement will make the Hinds County criminal justice system smarter and fairer,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “If implemented, these reforms will make pretrial detainees, prisoners, corrections staff and the entire community safer, while also ensuring that vulnerable individuals get access to the treatment, care and community services they need and deserve.  We commend the county for its commitment to making these reforms a reality.” “For too long, the conditions in the Jail have posed a serious challenge to law enforcement and the safety of our community,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis of the Southern District of Mississippi.  “I appreciate the commitment made by Hinds County officials to turn the page and begin making necessary reforms.” The settlement agreement – subject to approval by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi – requires the county to implement a series of reforms across various stages of the criminal justice system, including the following: Together these reforms aim to improve communication and coordination among criminal justice entities and community service providers to help individuals with mental illness transition back to the community and to reduce recidivism.  If approved by the federal district court, an independent monitor will be appointed to assess the county’s compliance.  In May 2015, the Justice Department completed a comprehensive investigation – which included on-site inspections, document reviews and stakeholder interviews by department experts and staff – and issued a findings letter that determined that Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center violated CRIPA by failing to protect prisoners from violence by other prisoners and from improper use of force by staff.  The department also found that inadequate staffing and training, a backlog in record filing and a lack of centralized information resulted in prisoners being held beyond court-ordered release dates. CRIPA authorizes the department to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional rights of persons confined in a jail, prison or other correctional facility.  For more information on the Civil Rights Division’s work in this area, please visit www.justice.gov/crt.

Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.   \n",

       "      <td>Glenn Eugene Halfin, 64, from Grapevine, Texas, appeared today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey L. Cureton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with an African-American family’s housing rights, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, Halfin threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment.  According to documents filed in connection with the guilty plea, on Dec. 19, 2017, Halfin purchased a baby doll at a Wal-Mart in Grapevine, Texas. He took a rope, fashioned it into a noose, and hung the baby doll from the noose. Halfin then hung the rope noose and baby doll on the railing directly in front of the only staircase the family could use to access their apartment. Halfin did so, knowing that this display would be particularly intimidating for the family who had a young daughter. In addition, the defendant referenced in his factual basis repeated intimidation of and interference with the same African-American family on other occasions. “The Justice Department will not tolerate acts of intimidation and fear, or illegal threats against any individual or family because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney John Gore. “We will continue to prosecute hate crime offenders.” “No one should be afraid to go home at night,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.  “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.” Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine. His sentencing is scheduled for October 24. This case was investigated by the FBI and the Grapevine Police Department. The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Rebekah Bailey of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section and Assistant United States Attorney Nicole Dana.</td>\n",

Hayes of the Western District of Washington. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.”   The complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Washington. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband, and their one year old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice.    The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, and civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.   The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin and disability. More information about the Civil Rights Division and the civil rights laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt  and https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/civil-rights. Individuals who believe that they have been victims of housing discrimination may call the Justice Department at 1-800-896-7743, email the Justice Department at fairhousing@usdoj.gov, or contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 or through its website at www.hud.gov.   The case is being jointly handled by the Department’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington.   The complaint is an allegation of unlawful conduct. The allegations must still be proven in federal court.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A Canadian woman was sentenced to serve 26 months in prison following her December conviction for international parental kidnapping, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Hansen of the Central District of Illinois.   Sarah M. Nixon, 48, of Montreal, Canada, was sentenced before U.S. District Judge Colin S. Bruce of the Central District of Illinois. On Dec. 21, 2016, a federal jury found Nixon guilty of one count of international parental kidnapping for taking her minor child from the United States to Canada in July 2015, with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of the father’s rights.   Evidence at trial established that after a custody trial where it was apparent that Nixon would lose custody of her six-year-old daughter, Nixon fled the United States with the child in the middle of the night. When she did not appear for the custody ruling and neither she nor her daughter could be located, law enforcement issued a child abduction alert. Nixon and the child were eventually located in a farmhouse in rural Ontario, Canada. Authorities then returned the child to the father. Nixon was arrested in New York on Sept. 20, 2015, as she attempted to return to the United States.    Trial Attorneys Elly M. Peirson and Lauren S. Kupersmith of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section prosecuted the case. The FBI; Urbana, Illinois, Police Department; University of Illinois Police Department; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services; Ontario Provincial Police; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection investigated the case, with assistance from the Champaign County, Illinois, State’s Attorney’s Office and the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Department of Justice today announced the update of the United States Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) with a new section titled, “Associate Attorney General’s Approval and Notice Requirements for Issues Implicating Religious Liberty.” On Oct. 6, 2017, the Attorney General issued a Memorandum for All Executive Departments and Agencies entitled Federal Law Protections for Religious Liberty. The memo directed components and United States Attorney’s Offices to use the guidance in litigation, advice to the Executive Branch, operations, grants, and all other aspects of the Department’s work. In order to ensure compliance with the Attorney General’s memo, the USAM will be updated with language that directs relevant Department of Justice components to: The updated USAM will also instruct relevant Justice Department components to consult the 20 religious liberty principles laid out in the Attorney General’s October 6 memo when considering whether the notice or approval requirements are initiated. In order to fully effectuate the approval and notice requirements in the updated USAM, the Department will instruct all U.S. Attorneys to designate a point of contact to lead these efforts for their office. “Religious liberty is an inalienable right protected by the Constitution, and defending it is one of the most important things we do at the Department of Justice,” said Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Sessions issued a robust and clear guidance document in October that clearly explains how the federal government is to apply the religious liberty protections currently on the books.  The requirement that each of the U.S. Attorney offices designate a religious liberty point of contact will ensure that the Attorney General’s Memorandum is effectively implemented. The designees will be responsible for working directly with the leadership offices on civil cases related to religious liberty, ensuring that these cases receive the rigorous attention they deserve.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement with the city of Yonkers, New York, and the Yonkers Police Department (YPD) to resolve the department’s investigation of YPD and ensure constitutional policing. The agreement is the result of the department’s investigation of YPD under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  In June 2009, the United States sent the city a technical assistance letter that identified necessary reforms to YPD practices and policies in the areas of use of force, civilian complaints, investigations, supervisory oversight and training.  After receiving the department’s technical assistance letter, the city and YPD made substantial changes to its policies and procedures.  This agreement implements and further improves those policies and procedures and addresses the department’s remaining concerns.  “This agreement will ensure that the Yonkers Police Department continues to advance constitutional, effective and community-oriented policing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “Through clear policy guidance, data analysis and accountability systems, we believe these reforms will make the entire community safer and strengthen public trust in the police.” “This agreement ensures that the Yonkers Police Department polices in a way that keeps its citizens safe, while protecting their constitutional rights,” said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.  “The measures put in place with this agreement, including clear and reasonable use-of-force policies and guidance on how to properly evaluate and respond to use-of-force incidents, will make Yonkers safer for citizens and police alike.  We thank the Yonkers Police Department and the city of Yonkers for cooperating with our investigation, and for joining our effort to ensure that the Yonkers Police Department protects its citizens not only from physical harm, but also from violations of their constitutional rights.” The agreement is carefully tailored to address the department’s remaining concerns while also taking into account and seeking to build upon the positive reforms YPD has already made following the department’s investigation.  Under the agreement, the YPD will, among other things: The agreement also provides that consultants retained by the department will conduct compliance reviews to ensure that YPD has implemented the measures required by the agreement and issue public reports of those compliance reviews. This case is being handled by the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York. Yonkers Police Department Agreement</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department today reached a landmark settlement agreement to reform the criminal justice system in Hinds County, Mississippi.  The agreement resolves the department’s findings that the Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center – which together form the Hinds County Jail – failed to protect prisoners from violence and excessive force and held them past their court-ordered release dates, in violation of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The settlement agreement is the first of its kind to incorporate broader criminal justice system reform through diversion at the front end and reentry to the community after incarceration.  It creates a criminal justice coordinating committee that will help ensure the county’s systems operate effectively and efficiently, develop interventions to divert individuals in appropriate cases from arrest, detention and incarceration, and engage in community outreach.  To promote successful reentry, the agreement includes mechanisms for notifying community health providers when a person with serious mental illness is released to help the person transition safely back to the community.  The agreement also addresses unlawful enforcement of court-ordered fines and fees by ensuring that the county cannot incarcerate an individual for non-payment if the court does not first assess whether the individual is indigent. “Across the board, this settlement will make the Hinds County criminal justice system smarter and fairer,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “If implemented, these reforms will make pretrial detainees, prisoners, corrections staff and the entire community safer, while also ensuring that vulnerable individuals get access to the treatment, care and community services they need and deserve.  We commend the county for its commitment to making these reforms a reality.” “For too long, the conditions in the Jail have posed a serious challenge to law enforcement and the safety of our community,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis of the Southern District of Mississippi.  “I appreciate the commitment made by Hinds County officials to turn the page and begin making necessary reforms.” The settlement agreement – subject to approval by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi – requires the county to implement a series of reforms across various stages of the criminal justice system, including the following: Together these reforms aim to improve communication and coordination among criminal justice entities and community service providers to help individuals with mental illness transition back to the community and to reduce recidivism.  If approved by the federal district court, an independent monitor will be appointed to assess the county’s compliance.  In May 2015, the Justice Department completed a comprehensive investigation – which included on-site inspections, document reviews and stakeholder interviews by department experts and staff – and issued a findings letter that determined that Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center violated CRIPA by failing to protect prisoners from violence by other prisoners and from improper use of force by staff.  The department also found that inadequate staffing and training, a backlog in record filing and a lack of centralized information resulted in prisoners being held beyond court-ordered release dates. CRIPA authorizes the department to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional rights of persons confined in a jail, prison or other correctional facility.  For more information on the Civil Rights Division’s work in this area, please visit www.justice.gov/crt.

       "      <td>The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.</td>\n",

Cureton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interfering with an African-American family’s housing rights, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, Halfin threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment.  According to documents filed in connection with the guilty plea, on Dec. 19, 2017, Halfin purchased a baby doll at a Wal-Mart in Grapevine, Texas. He took a rope, fashioned it into a noose, and hung the baby doll from the noose. Halfin then hung the rope noose and baby doll on the railing directly in front of the only staircase the family could use to access their apartment. Halfin did so, knowing that this display would be particularly intimidating for the family who had a young daughter. In addition, the defendant referenced in his factual basis repeated intimidation of and interference with the same African-American family on other occasions. “The Justice Department will not tolerate acts of intimidation and fear, or illegal threats against any individual or family because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney John Gore. “We will continue to prosecute hate crime offenders.” “No one should be afraid to go home at night,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox.  “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.” Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine.

Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Donald J. Cazayoux Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana.        Miller, 44, was convicted by a federal jury following a two-day trial.  U.S. District Judge James J.

Hayes of the Western District of Washington. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.”   The complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Washington. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband, and their one year old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice.    The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, and civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.   The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin and disability. More information about the Civil Rights Division and the civil rights laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt  and https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/civil-rights.

Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Hansen of the Central District of Illinois.   Sarah M. Nixon, 48, of Montreal, Canada, was sentenced before U.S. District Judge Colin S. Bruce of the Central District of Illinois. On Dec. 21, 2016, a federal jury found Nixon guilty of one count of international parental kidnapping for taking her minor child from the United States to Canada in July 2015, with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of the father’s rights.   Evidence at trial established that after a custody trial where it was apparent that Nixon would lose custody of her six-year-old daughter, Nixon fled the United States with the child in the middle of the night. When she did not appear for the custody ruling and neither she nor her daughter could be located, law enforcement issued a child abduction alert. Nixon and the child were eventually located in a farmhouse in rural Ontario, Canada. Authorities then returned the child to the father. Nixon was arrested in New York on Sept. 20, 2015, as she attempted to return to the United States.    Trial Attorneys Elly M. Peirson and Lauren S. Kupersmith of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section prosecuted the case.

The memo directed components and United States Attorney’s Offices to use the guidance in litigation, advice to the Executive Branch, operations, grants, and all other aspects of the Department’s work. In order to ensure compliance with the Attorney General’s memo, the USAM will be updated with language that directs relevant Department of Justice components to: The updated USAM will also instruct relevant Justice Department components to consult the 20 religious liberty principles laid out in the Attorney General’s October 6 memo when considering whether the notice or approval requirements are initiated. In order to fully effectuate the approval and notice requirements in the updated USAM, the Department will instruct all U.S. Attorneys to designate a point of contact to lead these efforts for their office. “Religious liberty is an inalienable right protected by the Constitution, and defending it is one of the most important things we do at the Department of Justice,” said Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Sessions issued a robust and clear guidance document in October that clearly explains how the federal government is to apply the religious liberty protections currently on the books.  The requirement that each of the U.S. Attorney offices designate a religious liberty point of contact will ensure that the Attorney General’s Memorandum is effectively implemented. The designees will be responsible for working directly with the leadership offices on civil cases related to religious liberty, ensuring that these cases receive the rigorous attention they deserve.   \n",

The agreement is the result of the department’s investigation of YPD under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  In June 2009, the United States sent the city a technical assistance letter that identified necessary reforms to YPD practices and policies in the areas of use of force, civilian complaints, investigations, supervisory oversight and training.  After receiving the department’s technical assistance letter, the city and YPD made substantial changes to its policies and procedures.  This agreement implements and further improves those policies and procedures and addresses the department’s remaining concerns.  “This agreement will ensure that the Yonkers Police Department continues to advance constitutional, effective and community-oriented policing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “Through clear policy guidance, data analysis and accountability systems, we believe these reforms will make the entire community safer and strengthen public trust in the police.” “This agreement ensures that the Yonkers Police Department polices in a way that keeps its citizens safe, while protecting their constitutional rights,” said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.  “The measures put in place with this agreement, including clear and reasonable use-of-force policies and guidance on how to properly evaluate and respond to use-of-force incidents, will make Yonkers safer for citizens and police alike.  We thank the Yonkers Police Department and the city of Yonkers for cooperating with our investigation, and for joining our effort to ensure that the Yonkers Police Department protects its citizens not only from physical harm, but also from violations of their constitutional rights.” The agreement is carefully tailored to address the department’s remaining concerns while also taking into account and seeking to build upon the positive reforms YPD has already made following the department’s investigation.  Under the agreement, the YPD will, among other things: The agreement also provides that consultants retained by the department will conduct compliance reviews to ensure that YPD has implemented the measures required by the agreement and issue public reports of those compliance reviews. This case is being handled by the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York. Yonkers Police Department Agreement   \n",
       "6905   The Justice Department today reached a landmark settlement agreement to reform the criminal justice system in Hinds County, Mississippi.  The agreement resolves the department’s findings that the Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center – which together form the Hinds County Jail – failed to protect prisoners from violence and excessive force and held them past their court-ordered release dates, in violation of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The settlement agreement is the first of its kind to incorporate broader criminal justice system reform through diversion at the front end and reentry to the community after incarceration.  It creates a criminal justice coordinating committee that will help ensure the county’s systems operate effectively and efficiently, develop interventions to divert individuals in appropriate cases from arrest, detention and incarceration, and engage in community outreach.  To promote successful reentry, the agreement includes mechanisms for notifying community health providers when a person with serious mental illness is released to help the person transition safely back to the community.  The agreement also addresses unlawful enforcement of court-ordered fines and fees by ensuring that the county cannot incarcerate an individual for non-payment if the court does not first assess whether the individual is indigent. “Across the board, this settlement will make the Hinds County criminal justice system smarter and fairer,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “If implemented, these reforms will make pretrial detainees, prisoners, corrections staff and the entire community safer, while also ensuring that vulnerable individuals get access to the treatment, care and community services they need and deserve.  We commend the county for its commitment to making these reforms a reality.” “For too long, the conditions in the Jail have posed a serious challenge to law enforcement and the safety of our community,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis of the Southern District of Mississippi.  “I appreciate the commitment made by Hinds County officials to turn the page and begin making necessary reforms.” The settlement agreement – subject to approval by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi – requires the county to implement a series of reforms across various stages of the criminal justice system, including the following: Together these reforms aim to improve communication and coordination among criminal justice entities and community service providers to help individuals with mental illness transition back to the community and to reduce recidivism.  If approved by the federal district court, an independent monitor will be appointed to assess the county’s compliance.  In May 2015, the Justice Department completed a comprehensive investigation – which included on-site inspections, document reviews and stakeholder interviews by department experts and staff – and issued a findings letter that determined that Hinds County Adult Detention Center and the Jackson City Detention Center violated CRIPA by failing to protect prisoners from violence by other prisoners and from improper use of force by staff.  The department also found that inadequate staffing and training, a backlog in record filing and a lack of centralized information resulted in prisoners being held beyond court-ordered release dates. CRIPA authorizes the department to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional rights of persons confined in a jail, prison or other correctional facility.  For more information on the Civil Rights Division’s work in this area, please visit www.justice.gov/crt.

Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.   \n",
